| Function is treated as a variable that can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument. | The function receives another function as an argument or returns First-order a new function or both.         |
| The “first-class” concept only has to do with functions in programming languages.4                     | The “higher-order” concept can be applied to functions in general, like functions in the mathematical sense. |
| The presence of the First-class function implies the presence of a higher-order function.              | The presence of a Higher-order function does not imply the presence of a First-order function.               |
|                                                                                                        | **Note:** Functions such as filter(), map(), reduce(),etc, all are examples of Higher-Order Functions.       |

| First-class functions are JavaScript functions that can **behave like variables.** pass function as argument or return function as variable | Higher-order function is a function that **accepts another function** |
